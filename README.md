# Excel Project
Project Details:
In this project i have cleaned Vrinda store sales data and after analysing all data,represented it using pivot charts in Excel
answering the following question:

1.What are the top 5 states making highest sales?

2.Which month has got highest sales and orders?

3.Who are more likely to purchase-men or women?

4.Which age group is contributing maximum in sales?

5.Which distribution channels are most effectively contributing to sales?

Lastly i have added slicers for Channel,Category and month for the ease of access and better data visualization
